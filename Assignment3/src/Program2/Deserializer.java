 * Deserialization will be implemented in a Java class called Deserializer, and will be invoked using the method:

public Object deserialize(org.jdom.Document document)

This method will deserialize an XML document passed in as parameter,
 returning the reconstituted object (and any objects it refers to).
  Use the facilities provided by JDOM to help with this, 
  in particular the Document and SAXBuilder classes.
